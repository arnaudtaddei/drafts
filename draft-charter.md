# Stopping Malware and Researching Threats (SMART) Proposed Research Group Charter 
 
The Stopping Malware and Researching Threats Research Group (or SMART RG) will research the effects, both positive and negative, of existing, proposed and newly published protocols and Internet standards on attack defence. It will gather evidence from information security practitioners on methods used to defend against attacks and make this available to protocol designers, implementers and users. As a result, designers, implementers and users of new protocols will be better informed about the possible impact on attack prevention and mitigation. The SMART RG aims to guide IETF protocol development and become the hub of expertise on attack defence in the IETF/IRTF. 

 
## BACKGROUND 

The IRTF is in a unique position to provide research and evidence on attacks and defence methods to the IETF. This research group aims to describe the effect of protocol changes on attack defence and stimulate methodical research into attack defence methods for new protocols. Protocols are already rigorously assessed for their security properties, but ensuring the consequences for attack defence are also rigorously assessed when protocol design changes are proposed would provide a fuller understanding of the value for such change, enabling a better engineered Internet.  

Protocol design decisions may have both positive and negative effects on attack defence. Examples of positive effects include the increased ability to detect botnet attacks or improved blocking of phishing emails. Negative effects include the provision of covert channels that can be used for command-and-control of malware or increasing exposure of servers to amplification attacks. Successful attacks may also have indirect negative effects including financial costs and reputational damage.  

This research group will adhere to the guidelines of [RFC 2804](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2804) for developing new detection techniques. 
 
## AIMS 
This research group has these major aims:  
- To bring **evidence on attacks**, including **malicious network behaviour**, and the defence methods to the attention of the IETF. 
- To produce **problem statements** that describe key issues in cyber security for the group to research.  
- To highlight the **attack mitigation impact**, both positive and negative, of **protocol design, deployment and operation**.  
- **To stimulate and generate research into attack defence methods** for new protocols, and to increase awareness in the technical community of new and existing methodology for detecting and mitigating attacks.  
- **To research network protocols and practices** with the aim of minimizing negative effects 
- To provide **systematic guidance** to designers of new protocols as to what attack defence considerations to review, and to inform implementers by default about the effects of new protocols on attack defence. 
- To become **the authority on attack defence** in the IETF/IRTF. 
 
## OUTPUTS 
The research group plans to create documents that may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
- **Internet drafts**, some of which may be published through the IRTF RFC stream. These will include outline problem statements, use cases, case studies and convey research results. They will be written for use by other groups to inform protocol designers, implementers and users.  
- **Policy papers**, for in-depth analysis and discussion of the relationship between attack defence and the Internet architecture and protocols.  
- **Research papers**, containing quantitative evidence of actual attacks and the success of defence methods against them, as well as theoretical and formal analyses of the implications of proposed protocols on attack defence. Defence methods will be analysed to determine if there are ways to optimise in order to better scale attack detection and mitigation. 
- **Survey** current and historic IETF material to discover existing deliberations on attack defence.  
- **Best practice papers** describing methodologies that will enable researchers to conduct experiments and report results that are useful to designers of protocols. These methodologies will give descriptions of the effects of protocols on attack defence backed by evidence from real-world attacks, laboratory-based testing and theoretical analysis of protocols, through the analysis lens of attacks, detection methods and systematic assessment methodologies.  
 
Within the first year, the research group aims to:  
- Survey existing attack detection methods and determine the relative effectiveness of these methods against different attack defence threats (e.g. phishing, DDoS, spambots, C&C, endpoint malware) 
- Publish case studies of historical attacks and make recommendations where attacks could have been stopped more quickly, or even prevented  
- Publish an informational Internet Draft, titled: "Important Attack Defence Considerations for Protocol Design and Deployment"  
 
## MEMBERSHIP 
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain current with the published documents and mailing list issues. Wide participation from industry, academia, government and non-profits is encouraged.
